# Obsidian Modified Notes of Today

This plugin is a fork of [obsidian-daily-activity](https://github.com/trydalch/obsidian-daily-activity) plugin with limited functionality.

The only goal of this plugin is to add a function to Obsidian that inserts links of the notes which are created or modified on the date.

For a person who tend to stay up late like me, this plugin treats midnight hours as the previous date.
For example, 1:00 AM on 27 Aug 2024 is treated as 26 Aug 2024. Currently, this threshold is set to 3:00 AM.
